Crawling robot with silicone actuators. Project included silicone casting of pneumatic actuators, testing of different 3D printed molds and different actuator models. 
Revolutionary prestretch method was devised, utizing stored stretch energy for fast dual actuation. Special rig and pipeline for creation of such actuators was devised. The actuators were pneumatically powered.
A control circut utilizing solenoid valves, pneumatic pump and arduino was created and programmed. Actuators were mounted on light weight body to create a crawling robot. 
The resulting robot was capable of moving forward, turning, going up and down a slope, with speed that can be deemed high in this field.
