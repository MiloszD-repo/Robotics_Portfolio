This project contains a simulated car game with increasingly difficult tracks to complete, the game is programmed in python. The learning method chosen for this part was Genetic Algorithm. Experiments on values for number of cars in a population, number
of top performers selected for breeding the new generation and the mutation rate were made to determine the best parametgers.
The resulting average completion time was 2.29 s in 57 generations.
