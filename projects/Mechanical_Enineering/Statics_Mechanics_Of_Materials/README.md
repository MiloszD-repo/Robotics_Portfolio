This project is about calculation of forces and stress in and Automatic Mobile Robot (AMR). This is done to determin the risk of failure during operation. 
After the factor was deterimned to be lower than required (increased risk) a new stronger design utilizing the same amount of material was proposed and the same factor was calculated.
