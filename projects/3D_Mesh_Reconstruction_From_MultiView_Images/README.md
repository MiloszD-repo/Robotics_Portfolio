This project is based on the premise of testing NVIDIA's nvdiffrec tool to extract and create 3D models ( triangular meshes) from multiview images of an object. The project tries to evaluate the tool's prefromance with realworld dataset.
A rig to create such a data set was made. The rig allowed for precise camera positions during dataset aqusition. The semi automatic rig allowed for controlled experiments to objectively evaluate influence of chosen parameters on the resu;ting 3D model.
Masking tools for background segmentation where also researched and evaluated. 
Created pipline allowed for complete semi-automatic dataset aquisition of a given object, along with camera poses and creation of accurate 3D model of any given object.
