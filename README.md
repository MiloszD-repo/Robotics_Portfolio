# Robotics_Portfolio
Welcome to my robotics and automation engineering portfolio.  
This repository showcases a selection of systems and programs I designed either alone or as part of a group project.  
The repository contains both work, university and freelance projects.

Work projects are intetionally described in a way to not reveal confidential information.

This portfolio supports my applications to robotics, software, automation, and mechatronics engineering roles.
