# Scalable Raw Material Loading System – Concept, Design & Prototyping  
### Industrial R&D Project – Full System Ownership

After the successful development of the initial raw material loading prototype, I was tasked with expanding the concept into a **scalable, faster, and more reliable automated system**. This next-generation design aimed to eliminate the need for repeated smoothing operations, reduce cycle time, and support additional processing steps required by production.

I was responsible for the full development cycle, including concept development, 3D modeling, system architecture, prototyping, validation, and delivering technical presentations to management and investors.

## Objectives

- Create a **scalable version** of the previous casing-loading system  
- Replace complex robot motions with **simplified, high-reliability mechanisms**  
- Increase throughput and reduce the need for additional smoothing operations  
- Integrate multiple new processing steps for casing preparation  
- Reduce cost by using **5 low-DOF robots** instead of multi-purpose arms  
- Plan a full production-ready machine layout with safety and operator ergonomics  
- Validate concepts through prototyping with KUKA robots and the existing sorting machine  

---

## Concept Development

The project began with exploring multiple solution concepts and refining the most promising ones into viable mechanical concepts.

Key innovations included:

- **Removing the smoothing robot entirely**  
- Replacing complex multi-axis motions with **simple piston- and belt-driven mechanisms**  
- Designing a layout using **five low-degree-of-freedom robots** for cost reduction and scalability  
- Introducing a **mandrel-based placement system** for batch handling  
- Planning a fully automated switching mechanism for mandrels between loads  

These changes significantly simplified the process, reduced cycle time, and increased system reliability.

## 3D Modeling & System Design

All 3D modeling was performed by me in **Autodesk Inventor**, including:

### **Machine Architecture**

- Creation of a full **multi-station robotic cell model**, built from separate parts and subassemblies  
- Integration of all moving components with respect to realistic motion constraints  
- Application of key functional dimensions such as pick areas, robot reach zones, and belt travel  
- Creative problem-solving to eliminate collisions and interferences between moving systems  
- Ergonomic placement of operator positions and safety elements in the workstation  

### **Scalability & Cost Optimization**

- Replacement of high-DOF robots with simpler robot units  
- Mechanical simplification of previously robot-driven processes  
- Modular design allowing the system to scale to higher throughput  

### **Visualization & Presentation**

I created a full visual presentation of the machine concept for management and investors, showing:

- System workflow  
- Motion sequences  
- Station interactions  
- Planned operator involvement  
- Cost-saving measures  
- Scalability strategy  

The concept received strong positive feedback.

## Expansion of the Project Scope

After approval of the scaled picking and placing model, management requested integration of **additional automated processing steps** to address casing imperfections commonly encountered in production.

These included:

- **Uneven End Detection**  
- **Uneven End Cutting**  
- **Slit Detection**  
- **Slit Cutting**  
- **Casing Waste Managment**  

I developed concepts for all of these new processes, integrating each into the existing machine model in the same manner:

- Original idea generation  
- Mechanical concept design  
- 3D modeling in Inventor  
- Motion visualization  
- Integration into the full system architecture  

---

## Prototyping & Validation

To verify the feasibility of the new concepts, I:

- Built prototype mechanisms using the **KUKA robot** and the existing sorting machine  
- Tested each new process separately  
- Refined the concepts based on real system feedback  
- Validated the cycle logic and interaction between processes  
- Confirmed that each subsystem could be automated as designed or redesigned the previous concepts

These prototypes were essential in demonstrating the viability of the final production system.

## My Role

I was solely responsible for:

- Full concept development  
- System integration planning  
- 3D modeling (parts, assemblies, motion visualization)  
- Robotic workflow design  
- Prototyping and testing  
- Presentation to stakeholders and investors  

This project required **creativity, multidisciplinary engineering, and end-to-end system thinking**, especially given the unusual and irregular nature of casings as a handled material.

## Project Structure

Each subsystem has its own detailed folder:

/uneven-end-detection
/uneven-end-cutting
/slit-detection
/slit-cutting
/casing-length-detection-and-sorting

---

## Outcome

The final scaled concept offered:

- Higher throughput  
- Simplified mechanics  
- Lower cost  
- Significantly reduced failure points  
- Expanded automation capabilities  

It established a clear upgrade path from a functional prototype to an industrial-scale automated system.
