Project with the goal of moving natural casing detection on mantle. Specyfic focus was put to detect the end of a casing without direct contact. Multiple comercial and custom methods investigated. Results were two non-contact methods, with one showing great promise. 
This project involved 3D printing for sensor mounting and water protection. Electronic work, arduino and STM32 micorcontroler programing. Research, and aquisition of experimental sensors as well as creation of a new sensor with use of common electronic components.
The first resulting prototype showed ..% accuracy with changing environments. It was resistant to outside interference such as vibration or moisture.
