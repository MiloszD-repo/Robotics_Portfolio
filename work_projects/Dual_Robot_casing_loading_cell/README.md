This was a project in colaboration with Danish Technical Institute as part of Innobooster program from Danish Innovation Fund. The project consisted of two parts: casing detection and casing handling. The casing handling part required two different stages, preparation for detection and picking after detection. To demonstrate a proof of concept two high level system protoypes were made and integrated together. The preparation part was handled by a KUKA KR 6 R900-2 with a custom gripper, and the picking part by Universal Robots UR5e. A custom cell complete with a HALCON camera, and safety features was designed and maunfactured. The project yeilded picking accuracy of about 90% with one run of the smoothing system. The completion rate went up to 95% when second smoothing operation was done. 99% with 3 smoothing operations. The system was capable of error detection and repair ( initiating additional smothing operations to help with picking attempts). The inacuracies were mainly caused by errors in the external vision system, with not fully favourable picking postions determined with increase of casings to pick from. The protype system highly automated the process of loading casings with up to 20 casings handled at one time. It eliminated the problem of manualy inserting the casings onto hooks for the sorting machine one by one by only requiring the operator to lay the casings untied but bundled together on the table. The shortcomings of firsts attepts where adressed by redesign of the gripper for smoothing in a way so it could reprepare the not picked or messed up casings for new picking process. The scope of  the project required multiple tests and iterations, hardware and software design. After completion of the project with astounding results key areas for improvement to achieve 100% completion rate where identified to implement in the full product, such as too short picking area and and URs range.
Project Overview
## Iteration & Improvements

Several shortcomings observed in early prototypes were addressed through:

- Redesign of the smoothing gripper to include an additional feature that allowed it to retrieve casings that were displaced or dropped during the picking process, enabling them to be reintroduced into the smoothing area for another preparation cycle.
- Multiple hardware and software iterations to improve system robustness, accuracy, and repeatability.
- Identification of key improvements for the final product version, including:
  - Increasing the effective picking area
  - Adjusting robot reach and overall cell layout
